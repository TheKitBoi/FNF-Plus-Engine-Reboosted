# Friday Night Funkin' - Plus Engine Reboosted
The engine that is combined with three engines into a cool engine, its combined with [Psych Engine](https://gamebanana.com/mods/309789), [Modding Plus](https://harlessben321.itch.io/fnf-modding-plus) and [Kade Engine](https://gamejolt.com/games/kade-engine/645930)

## Installation:
Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

You can do this with: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
